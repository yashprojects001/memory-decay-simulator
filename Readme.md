## 🌈 What Is This Project?

**Memory Decay Simulator** is a smart web-based tool that simulates how **human memory fades over time** using principles from **cognitive psychology**.

Instead of guessing *when to revise*, this tool **calculates and visualizes** memory decay so learners can revise at the **right moment**.

---

## 🔥 Why This Project Is Special

✅ Not a typical CRUD app  
✅ Based on **real psychological theory**  
✅ Combines **math + psychology + code**  
✅ Looks like a **research tool**, not a toy  
✅ Easy to explain, hard to forget 😉

## 🧠 The Science Behind It

This project is inspired by the **Forgetting Curve**, which shows that memory loss follows an **exponential decay** pattern.

```text
Retention = e ^ (-k × time)
Where:

⏳ time = days since last study
⚙️ k = decay constant (depends on difficulty & confidence)

📉 Harder topics fade faster
📈 Higher confidence slows forgetting
